# Project Status Tracker

## Current Focus
- Implementing transformer toolkit per `PLAN.md` roadmap.

## Completed
- Packaging scaffold (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`) with pinned dependencies.
- Initial package scaffolding (`trading_transformers/` modules for data, features, models, training, evaluation).
- Baseline feature builder and Brooks-style tokenizer prototype.
- Data catalog with zip extraction utilities.
- Data CLI and resampling helpers.
- PyTorch Lightning forecasting scaffold and experiment runner/CLI.
- Evaluation/backtesting CLIs and configs.
- Brooks token analytics toolkit and CLI.
- Fusion encoder scaffold for continuous + token inputs integrated with training pipeline.
- Interactive notebooks for workflow and token analysis (fusion-ready).

## In Progress
- Documentation polish across modules.

## Upcoming
- Fusion experiments on real datasets and multimodal training loops.
- Advanced backtesting reports and attribution tooling.
- Packaging/environment setup for deployment.
